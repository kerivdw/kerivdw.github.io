        <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        <p>A memorable dilemma I faced as a parent was the debate over… is Father Christmas real.  My own youngest daughter came to be at a tender age of 6 years old.  She blurted out as a matter of fact <span id="quote">“Mom, Father Christmas is not real!”</span>  A little surprised by her confidence, I asked,  <span id="quote">“Oh, how do you know?”.</span>  She proudly declared.  <span id="quote">“Because I googled it.”</span> At that moment I was stuck in an ethical dilemma.</p>
  
        <p>Half proud at her resourcefulness but also feeling mixed emotions that my youngest child is growing up so quickly.  Thoughts  went through my head at that moment.  Do I tell her Father Christmas is not real and cut short her magical memories of christmas?  Do I lie to her and tell her what she has read is untrue?  If I tell her Father Christmas is not real, will she spill the beans and ruin it for her friends?</p>
  
        <p>Values of honesty, trust and integrity and Ingenuity and compassion rose in me. My need for my daughter to understand that I would be honest with her, she could trust what I was saying.  Wanting her to realise she had the ability to find the answers to questions she had and could trust them. After consideration I said <span id="quote">“Yes you are correct, Father Christmas is not real.”</span></p>
  
        <p>On reflection if faced with this decision again, I would make the same decision.   Although there were no longer presents from Father Christmas.  She learned that she could trust what we said to her even if the message was difficult.  She learnt that if she wanted to find the right answers to a question she had the ability to go and look for those answers.  She learned to be discrete and not ruin the joy for others.  Our Christmases also changed instead of presents coming from a Father Christmas, we started to buy presents for each other.  She learnt the joy of giving rather than receiving.</p>
  
        <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
  
        <p>I was lucky enough to grow up in two countries as a child, giving me a wider view of the world at a tender age.  I was born in South Africa and lived my formative years there.  My parents ran their own electrical business and my Dad, South African born, was heavily involved in running and sailing.  My sisters and I attended a catholic school.  As a child I was instilled with values of honesty and integrity, hard work, gratitude, not giving up and to excel in what I did.  To treat people equally and with respect.  I would say growing up in South Africa also instilled a sense of fairness in me, seeing at that tender age that at time’s things were not always fair and equal.</p>
  
        <p>My sisters and I moved with my mother to her home country, New Zealand.  This is where I grew up from my teenage years onwards.  Life was very different in New Zealand and we had to learn very quickly to be responsible and independent.  From living a largely sheltered life to a single parent home I had a lot more responsibility for myself and my sisters at times.</p>
  
        <p>I would say that my values were largely influenced by my mother, through her character and the necessity of our circumstances.  All of these experiences have built on who I am today.  Others who have influenced my values include my dad and teachers and also my husband.</p>
  
        <p>I have core values of family, honesty and integrity, loyalty, kindness and independence.  I also carry strong values of hard work and resilience.</p>
  
        <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
  
        <p>My strengths include problem solving, communication, hard work, attention to detail and resilience.  These will definitely support me on this journey.  There will be many situations that I haven’t encountered previously so having the ability to break things down and see it to the end, asking for help if needed will see me in good stead.</p>
  
        <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
  
        <p>Life has taught me to be fiercely independent and I can be introverted at times.  Unintentionally I can get focused on my own track and charge to the finish line forgetting to look up.  I need to remember to cast a wider view of the map and keep an eye on what is going on around me.  Remembering to connect with others around me to enrich my own experience, using the strength of the team to succeed in the tasks we complete.</p>
  
        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
  
        <p>A situation where I tried to work productively with others and there was resistance or tension, relates to a previous role.  A colleague of mine had built an automation suite, separate to the current automation suite we were using at the time.  In support of a collaborative effort I suggested and strongly encouraged my colleague to share the project and look to make it the current automation suite going forward.  We agreed to start by each of us contributing to the suite and then sending a pull request to give feedback.  On the first pull request my college merged the request and didn’t read it.  Later when they were making their own changes they became very frustrated as the change’s I had made were not what they expected. </p>
  
        <p>This led to a great deal of conflict over the project.  My college was quite defensive and very rude about it.  I did try to engage them, I was unsuccessful in doing so.  I also sought outside help from others in and outside the company.  I realised it wasn’t something I would be able to resolve so at that point I withdrew from the situation.  The outcome of the situation was that the project was never truly a collaborative project, in the same way other projects I worked on in different teams and companies were.  It was just my colleague's project.  Although developers and test analysts did contribute our tests to it.  It was mainly driven by one person.</p>
  
        <p>The part’s I own from this situation are,  I had good intentions, in encouraging my college to promote their work.  In hindsight, I did make a mistake in strongly encouraging them to share the project.  They built the project with the intention of just working on it themselves and in hindsight they were not ready to share it in a collaborative way. On reflection I should, still have promoted their work but left them to share it when they were ready.</p>
  
        <p>The other part I feel I could have done better, was to withdraw from the situation sooner.  When my colleague was very rude to me, I did not react as well as I could have to the situation.  I attempted to reiterate our agreement, but in doing so it also pointed out their mistake that they merged the changes without reading them.  In this situation, having used better conflict resolution skills and using better language to de-escalate the situation more efficiently could have reduced the level of frustration.</p>
