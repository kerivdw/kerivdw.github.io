        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p> My medium to long term goal is to get a position as a software developer.  My long term goal would be to learn as much as I can once I am in that role.  I plan to learn from reading, observing and doing.  Understanding the reasons for why things are done.  Also just to enjoy myself working in teams and working on projects that allow me to extend and grow my knowledge.</p>
  
        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p>My strengths of independence, hard work and resilience, will serve me well when it comes to learning new ideas and concepts.  The flip side of being independent is that I need to remember to collaborate with others on thoughts and idea's as well so that I don't become to narrowly focused and miss out on the bigger picture.</p>
  
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>Having worked in teams for a long time, my collaborative skills have developed around work and getting tasks completed, not building the same piece of work together, where you have to make it all fit at the end.  I am excited to strengthen my skills in this area.  I'm looking forward to the deliberate practice that bootcamp will provide to facilitate this.</p>
        <p>I would really love to have stronger skills for dealing with conflict.  Working in teams it is something you often see either between others in a team or you and another person may not agree on a specific point of view.  Being able to deal with other peoples feelings and negotiate these situations well, would be a great skill to have.  We don't often get good practice in these types of situations as emotions are always high when they happen.  Having good strategies and feeling confident to handle these situations well would be a success for me.</p>
  
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
        <p>
          I plan to manage my workload by; working in a consistent way, doing less more, planning my work for the day or week, eating and sleeping well, exercising and keeping to a routine.  This has been a little disrupted with getting covid in the second sprint of the course.  I feel like things are moving back on track.</p>
  
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>In relation to the work I will try to stick to the timeboxes, If I am not able to solve that issue myself, Then I can reach out in the discord channels and ask a question to see if someone is able to help me out.  If I am still not able to find the answer.  I can ask one of the facilitators to help me out.  If I have any situations, outside of the course, that occur that prevent me from doing my work or delaying it.  I will let my facilitators David and Naomi know in a timely manner.</p>
  
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>The facilitation team, are there to coach me through the course.  Help when I'm blocked on the course or stuck and haven't been able to resolve it through other means, they're not there to solve the problem we're having but suggest other things to try.  They're also there to provide feedback on our progress.  They play a coaching rather than a mentorship role on the course.  Although they do sometimes provide mentorship from time to time, it isn't something to be expected</p>
  
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        <p>From the 17th to the 19th of February.  I will be unavailable, my eldest daughter is starting University in Auckland, We will be dropping her off at her residential accommodation on that weekend</p>
