          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            On completion of this course, my goal is to apply for software development roles.  With the view to gaining a role in a company where I am able to continue to build on the skills I have learnt at dev academy.  I would like to work in a company that is small enough that I have enough variety and opportunity to learn new things in my work, but large enough that there are experienced people that I am able to learn from to grow my own skill set.
          </p>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to learning, I am quite focused and disciplined. I am independent and resilient to challenges.  I enjoy learning new things, which makes the process enjoyable for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of limitations, I can become overwhelmed when there is a lot of content.  I need to pause a little and make sure I have understood everything rather than continuing through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think also my shyness in groups and situations where it is required to talk about myself personally could be challenging initially but hopefully it will get more comfortable with practice. 
          </p>
          <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            I would say that on the whole, my time management is fairly good.  When there are things that are particularly challenging I do lose track of time.  I will need to be strict on myself to timebox those challenges, ask for help and take breaks.  So that I don’t let the other team members down in shared challenges.
          </p>
          <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>
            Solid collaboration skills, tech is built in teams.  This means working with others to make all the parts come together.  This is something I am excited to practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            With best intentions, when working in teams from time to time conflict will still arise.  This is something I am not fully confident with.  I would love to have stronger skills in dealing with conflict.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Being able to process other people's feelings and negotiate these situations well, would be a great skill to have.  Having good understanding and strategies for handling these types of situations would be a success for me.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            My understanding is that in the bootcamp is the practical part of the flipped learning concept.  We have spent the last 5 weeks being supported through a self learning phase, this part will be a phase where we will put that knowledge into practice in groups in real world examples with real world feedback.
          </p>
          <p>My expectation is that the bootcamp team is there to facilitate that process;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>by facilitating group learning, using the strength of the group to solve problems</li>
            <li>by providing coaching and technical support on how to approach different problems</li>
            <li>by providing coaching and support in human skills on how to deal with different situations.</li>
            <li>by providing feedback on progress at intervals</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            My expectation of myself during bootcamp is that  I will have an opportunity to practice and build on the technical and human skills learnt in foundation.  Working with others in a respectful, predictable and transparent way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will manage my workload through planning my work well.  Using my calendar to keep a track of lectures and catch up’s that I have planned.  Blocking out focused time in my calendar to complete any tasks I have agreed to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will also ensure that during this time I will take responsibility for my own well being.  Ensuring that I am eating well, getting enough rest and exercising during this period.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will help myself when I am blocked by setting timeboxes for a problem, if I am stuck I can look at previous lessons or search google for the answer.  If this does not unblock me I can ask someone in my team on discord for help.  If I am still not able to find the answer I can ask one of the course facilitators to help me out.  If I have any situations that occur outside of the course I can let one of the course facilitators know in a timely way.
