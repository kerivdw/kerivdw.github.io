        <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
          This week I had a problem. I needed to solve a code challenge, to create a gradebook. This involved accessing objects and arrays.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give a little context of what this means. Think of objects and arrays as a literal thing, using javascript methods, equate to action’s that are performed on a thing, in real life there are a set of actions you can perform with a physical object, and there are ones that you can't. For example if I had a house and a cup. As a regular person an action I can apply to the cup is pick up the cup. I would find it very difficult to do this to a house. So pick up wouldn’t be an action I would be able to apply to a house.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started this challenge with some theory on objects, arrays and methods however I had very little experience using these types of objects and methods consistently. When I got into solving problems, working with both objects and arrays at the same time, I mixed up all the actions. I attempted to apply object methods to arrays and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt quite frustrating, with the code not working as I intended. It seemed like it should be easier as I had used loops many times before.  This meant I ended up going over the time box that had been allocated for this challenge. However, as the point of the challenge was to learn something I kept going as I wanted to understand how it worked and get it right.
        </p>
        <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
        <p>
          I also worked on a problem this week, where I needed to run a method over some data to update an array.  To change the data in the array numbers to an array of words made up of Fizz and Buzz based on the multiple of the number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having learned about maps in the previous exercise I understood how this could work for this challenge.  For context map is something that takes one array and converts it into another array but with the values changed.  When it came to this challenge it all came together relatively easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt quite satisfying that the answers and code just flowed and I was able to put it together quite easily with seemingly little effort.
        </p>
        <h3>How confident am I using these problem solving techniques?</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Pseudocode</em> - This is something I am fairly comfortable with when creating something new.  It is harder when there is already a block of code that you need to change.  When starting something new it is useful to write down all the steps first.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Trying something</em> - This is my go to approach with learning how things work.  Trying things and seeing what the result is if I try it in different ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rubber ducky method</em> - I found this quite useful.  Talking out loud through the problem helps me to understand not just what I am doing but clarify why I am doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Reading error messages</em> - I am fairly confident in using error messages with google and finding reasons for why they happen.  I wouldn’t say I understand all types of error messages yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Console.logging</em> - this is another go to favorite, it is really useful for understanding the data transformations and flow of paths.  I use this a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Googling</em> - googling is something I do often when things go wrong, or if I want a reference to something I am working with like using MDN to learn about arrays.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Asking your peers for help</em> - This is something I probably have been less forthright about, generally I go through the channel and see if someone has asked the question already and then work through those answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Asking coaches for help</em> - Again this is something I need to do more often, when I have asked our coaches for help it has been really helpful and useful to become unblocked and gain better understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Improving your process with reflection</em> - I would say this is something that I generally do consistently.  When things don’t go well I like to understand why so that I can do them better the next time around.
