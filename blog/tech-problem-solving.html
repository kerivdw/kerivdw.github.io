        It is pretty true that most of us at one time or another have had a blocking problem.  Just recently I had a problem.  I needed to solve a code challenge, to create a gradebook.  This involved accessing objects and arrays.
      </p>
       <p>
        To give a little context of what this means.  Think of objects and arrays as a literal thing, using javascript methods, equate to action’s that are performed on a thing, in real life there are a set of actions you can perform with a physical object, and there are ones that you can't.  For example if I had a house and a cup.  As a regular person an action I can apply to the cup is <em>pick up the cup</em>.  I would find it very difficult to do this to a house.  So <em>pick up</em> wouldn’t be an action I would be able to apply to a house.
      </p>
       <p>
        I started this challenge with some theory on objects, arrays and methods however I had very little experience using these types of objects and methods consistently.  When I got into solving problems, working with both objects and arrays at the same time, I mixed up all the actions.  I attempted to apply object methods to arrays and vice versa. 
      </p>
       <p>
        This led to some frustration, with the code not working as I intended. This meant I ended up going over the time box that had been allocated for this challenge.  However, as the point of the challenge was to learn something I kept going as I wanted to understand how it worked and get it right.
      </p>
       <h3>The steps I went through in this instance;</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Re-reading the instructions to make sure I hadn’t missed anything.</li>
        <li>Reading through the MDN documentation to see how the methods I was using worked.</li>
        <li>Going through some of the course video’s particularly brackets vs dot notation.</li>
        <li>Google, google and <em>more</em> google.</li>
        <li>In our weekly stand up for our home group
          <ul>
            <li>I asked a question about maps vs loops, this set me on the right track,  as I read more into how these worked after hearing the explanation and re-looking at the code I realised I was applying the wrong methods for the object I was working on.</li>
            <li>We also talked about taking breaks, which I hadn’t done as I wanted to nut through the problem.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Working through the problem with a clearer head and a better understanding I managed to create some very ugly but working code.  Success!</li>
        <li>Happy that the code was working as I expected, after testing it.  I then refactored it, simplifying things that I had made a little verbose.  Then tested it to make sure it was all working. Ship it!</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>How I could improve this process in the future;</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>On reflection I could have shortcut the process if I had clarified my understanding of the methods earlier asking in the group.  Sometimes that is tricker when you don’t know what you don’t know.   </li>
        <li>Also taking a small break in between this challenge when it got hard, may have refreshed my thinking and I might have seen where I went off track earlier.</li>
       </ul>
