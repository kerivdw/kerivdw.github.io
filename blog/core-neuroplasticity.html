        Neuroplasticity is a psychological principle that the brain has the ability to change its neural networks.  It is a term to describe the brainâ€™s ability to make new connections when the brain is exposed to new information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growth mindset relates to the underlying belief a person holds about a person's intelligence or the ability to learn new things.  Dr Carol Dwek, a psychologist , coined the term to describe a mindset where if students were made aware that they had the ability to become smarter through deliberate effort it would motivate them to put in the extra effort required to achieve higher results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a growth mindset enables us to create the right conditions to enable our brain's ability to learn. If we believe we are capable of learning new things, we will dedicate more time to deliberate and repeated practice.  We will activate our brain's neuroplasticity, and build new neurological connections, by exposing the brain to new thoughts and ideas.  When coupling this principle and belief it will build up the knowledge and muscle memory required to maximise our learning.
      </p>
      <h3>There are a number of principles we can follow to encourage a growth mindset and activate neuroplasticity;</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>welcome new challenges</li>
        <li>persist when challenges become difficult</li>
        <li>understand that deliberate practices increases your capability</li>
        <li>welcome constructive criticism</li>
        <li>learn from others success</li>
       </ul>
