      <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is a psychological principle that the brain has the ability to change its neural networks.  It is a term to describe the brainâ€™s ability to make new connections when the brain is exposed to new information.  Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity supports an understanding that we are all capable of learning new things.
      </p>
      <h3>How will I engage in the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?</h3>
      <p>
        I will engage in the principles of neuroplasticity through repitition and repeated practice.  Challenging myself to do things in new ways and gaining new insights and understanding in the code, concepts and problems that myself or other are working on.   I will increase my problem solving skills and adaptability to solving challenges in different ways and embrace self care and exercise.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways to increase Neuroplasticity:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Learning new concepts and ideas</li>
          <li>Rest, exercise and self care</li>
          <li>Mindfulness</li>
          <li>Play, trying new things with curiosity</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset relates to the underlying belief a person holds about a person's intelligence or the ability to learn new things.  Dr Carol Dwek, a psychologist , coined the term to describe a mindset where if students were made aware that they had the ability to become smarter through deliberate effort it would motivate them to put in the extra effort required to achieve higher results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a growth mindset is relevant as it enables us to create the right conditions to enable our brain's ability to learn. If we believe we are capable of learning new things, we will dedicate more time to deliberate and repeated practice.  We will activate our brain's neuroplasticity, and build new neurological connections, by exposing the brain to new thoughts and ideas.  When coupling this principle and belief it will build up the knowledge and muscle memory required to maximise our learning.
      </p>
      <h3>What changes you about this exploration?</h3>
      <p>
        I am unsure what changes me specifically in this moment, but having a greater understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset.  I can go about improving my both my soft and technical skills, allowing me to make good choices when faced with different challenges and situations.  knowing that anything I feel in that moment is all part of the process.
      </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning plan through repitition, challenging myself and stepping out of my comfort zone.  Learning through feedback and mistakes.  Learning from others. Using self care when challenges are difficult.  Embracing constant curiosity learning new and interesting ways to solve challenges.
