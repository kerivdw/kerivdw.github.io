        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I learnt some really great tools for keeping life in balance,  journaling, focus time with time tracking and mindfulness as great ways for keeping life in check.  Something that I hope to keep improving on as the pressure intensifies  during bootcamp to keep a steady rhythm.
        </p>
        <p>
          It reinforced that I have a shy personality in some situations.  At times it was challenging.  Particularly for posts or conversations where I had to share personal information about myself.  Which I find quite easy in a one to one relationship where I am being asked for the information rather than pushing it out into an audience.  In our home groups I had to pre-prepare for those conversations and make notes. I struggle to be myself talking in a group until I know the people quite well.  Core made me more aware , that it is something I could strengthen. It would help me with my communication and interacting in bigger groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found the listening and looping exercise very interesting.  It made me realise that I often feel the pressure to respond to someone straight away.  So that they know I am listening to them.  Completing that exercise actually felt like a relief that there was no expectation to respond.  This is a skill I would like to consciously continue to improve on and cement in boot camp.  Being comfortable with the space in the conversation.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
          The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and in life, are that they are connected to our beliefs, motivations, self awareness and people skills.  These behave as guide rails in how we view the world and choose to participate in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In learning and programming, it is important to have self awareness.  So when we have feelings that come out of trying to challenge ourselves or interact with someone else who has different values to our own.  We can see the bigger picture and understand what our part is in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the bigger picture we can ensure that we make the best decisions for ourselves and the group we’re connected to at that moment.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          In a positive way, it was quite a lot of work.  I didn’t expect this when starting the course.  However I also really enjoyed the work and it was a nice change up. Learning about core skills allowed a switch of focus at times.  It worked well as it spaced out different types of thinking.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The most challenging part for me wasn't specifically core or tech.  It was related to the the volume of work.  I am a person that likes to think deeply before I put something into writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times when there was a lot to get through.  I would sometimes miss some of the points on the topics we were covering.  I had to go back and redo a couple of things once I realised I had done that.  Now that I am aware of this I've made a mental note to remind myself to slow down when I feel rushed.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          Many reasons, to be a successful developer you need to be quite self motivated and organised, self aware and a great communicator.  You’re working in teams with many different types of people, some technical, some from the business.  They all have different views and motivations around how something should or shouldn’t be done and when it needs to be done by.  To navigate those situations you need to have a good sense of yourself.  At times you or others in your team will be faced with tough challenges.  You need to be able to support each other and navigate those situations without putting undue pressure on yourself or others so that you call all perform well as a team.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Bootcamp is an intense environment that likely fosters some of those situations, giving you more opportunity to practice these situations, which in reality don’t come up as often in real life.  In an environment where you can gain some real insight and feedback which you often don’t always get in the real world.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          I didn’t feel this way.  I found it was a good break in between coding challenges to be focusing on a different topic.  I enjoyed learning something new.  It was a different type of thinking, it was more about how I thought and felt rather than logic and problem solving.  It was actually harder for me to do these challenges at times.  I had to go away and think about some of the reason for what I thought about these situations.  I also found it hard to relate questions to myself or talk about myself at times. A good example would be the question we had about Neuroplasticity. I know why it is good, but I am unsure how it changes me at this moment.  I figure I can plant the seed on those questions and let them germinate and in time it will come together in time.
