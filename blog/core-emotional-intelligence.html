        While IQ the intelligence quotient relates to our ability to solve problems and logic.  EQ the emotional quotient, also known as emotional intelligence, relates to our ability to recognize the emotions in ourselves and others.
      </p>

        Emotional intelligence is very important, especially when working within teams.  It allows us to be able to build relationships with others.  It helps us to talk through problems when they are not going to plan and to deal with conflict when it arises.  Having healthy and trustful relationships leads to higher levels of happiness and satisfaction in teams and improves performance and outcomes for everyone.
      </p>
       <h3>Having higher levels emotional intelligence can help by;</h3>
       <p>
        Helping you to think before you act, realising that emotions are temporary.  When moments of friction occur, taking a moment to calm your feelings allows you to be more rational about a situation.
      </p>
       <p>
        Having greater self awareness allows you to think about how the other person may feel in any given situation and separate your own feelings from theirs, allowing you to empathise with their feelings.
      </p>

        <li>Practising non judgemental listening</li>
